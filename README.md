========

###Use LabVIEW to get Color, Depth, Infrared and Skeletal information from the Kinect One.

The MakerHub Interface for Kinect One provides an easy to use LabVIEW API for acquiring data from the Kinect One sensor. No hardware specific knowledge is required to start using the Kinect One video streams (RGB Color, Depth, Body Index and Infrared) and skeletal tracking information. 

*Note: the Microsoft Kinect One Requires Windows 8 x64 or later. The MakerHub Interface for Kinect One only works with the 32-bit version of LabVIEW running on Windows 8 x64 or later.*
